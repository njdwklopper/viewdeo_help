# Viewdeo

Viewdeo has gone through some massive changes recently. I was busy with development of a whole new Viewdeo App, with awesome new features. All of a sudden a change from Reddit forced me to publish this version which is still a bit unfinished. But all the main functionality that makes Viewdeo, Viewdeo is still working.


[Post Viewdeo Issues Here](https://github.com/njdwklopper/viewdeo_help/issues).

## Free and Full version have Same features

Both the Full and Free version of Viewdeo now have the exact same features, where the Free version will now be carried with Advertising.

## Downloading

Files are now Downloaded (With Permissions from you) to your **Download** Folder under ```viewdeo```

## Sharing

Viewdeo now downloads and processes Files in the background, and you can share the File from the Notification immediately after.
The Instant share won't work as before, because imagine a whole bunch of share sheets popping up at the same time.
Will add Instant Share back settings, which will only download in the foreground.

## Viewing Viewdeos

Files can now be played back right within Viewdeo. Future plans to add basic Editing like cropping and Trimming will soon be available too.
Viewdeos are also available in your Phone's Gallery too.

## History & Copy/Pasting of Links

Compatible Links can be pasted, after being copied from anywhere, by Swiping to the ***History and Copied Links*** page.
Every ***Download*** made by Viewdeo will automatically be saved on this Page for Future Downloads, or reference.
Tapping on an item opens it on the Web, Long Pressing a Link copies it to clipboard if you want to share it somewhere.
History items can be Re-Downloaded or Deleted from history with the Icons on the right.
A Pasted link on the Bottom can be downloaded or saved for later.

## Settings

Only Dark and Light Mode Setting is available for now.
All other Settings will be added back in SOON.

# Help

1. Use the app by sharing links to Viewdeo from other Apps like Reddit, Instagarm, Giphy and Gfycat.
2. Copy links and Paste them on the History Page.
