# Viewdeo

Viewdeo has gone through some massive changes recently. I was busy with a whole new App, but a change from Reddit force me to publish this version unfinished. But all the main functionality is still working.


[Post Viewdeo Issues Here](https://github.com/njdwklopper/viewdeo_help/issues).

## Free and Full version have Same features

Both Full and free have the same features, free now has Ads.

## Sharing

Viewdeo now downloads in the background, and you share from the Notification.
The Instant share won't work with this, because imagine a whole bunch of share sheets popping up athe same time.
Will add Instant Share back settings.

## Settings

Only Dark and Light Mode Setting for now.
All other Settings will be added back in the Future.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
