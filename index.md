# Viewdeo

Viewdeo has gone through some massive changes recently. I was busy with development of a whole new Viewdeo App, with awesome new features. All of a sudden a change from Reddit forced me to publish this version which is still a bit unfinished. But all the main functionality that makes Viewdeo, well Viewdeo is still working.


[Post Viewdeo Issues Here](https://github.com/njdwklopper/viewdeo_help/issues).

## Free and Full version have Same features

Both the Full and Free version of Viewdeo now have the exact same features, where the Free version will now be carried with Advertising.

## Sharing

Viewdeo now downloads and processes Files in the background, and you can share the File from the Notification immediately after.
The Instant share won't work as before, because imagine a whole bunch of share sheets popping up at the same time.
Will add Instant Share back settings, which will only download in the foreground.

## Settings

Only Dark and Light Mode Setting is available for now.
All other Settings will be added back in SOON.

# Help

1. Use the app by sharing links to Viewdeo from other Apps like Reddit, Instagarm, Giphy and Gfycat.
2. Copy links and Paste them on the History Page.
